=========
string = "welcome to tealeaf academy!"

a = string[6]
b = string[11]
c = string[19]

# we defined our string with the above statement. what we are
# looking for is what value comes up with 6, 11, 19. each letter
# and space between the words is one placement and it starts at
# 0. so at 6 it would be "e", 11 is "t", and 19 is "a"
